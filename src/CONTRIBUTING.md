Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

-   Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
-   Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
-   Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
-   Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site](https://auth0.com/docs).
-   Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
